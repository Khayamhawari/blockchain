                    <h2>What is a Service-Based Company?</h2>
                    <p>Service-based companies are the ones that do not have a particular product but their primary
                        business is to provide services. If we talk more clearly then they work for other organizations
                        or have client-based products. The services they provide are intangible and can be provided in
                        the terms of expertise, amenities, or skills. These companies generally provide less salary
                        compared to product-based companies. Some of the popular service-based companies are TCS,
                        Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, etc. </p>
